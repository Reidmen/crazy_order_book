# LOB
This repository contains an implementation of a Limit Order Book (LOB), purely written in python with the help of `sortedcontainers`. It's for learning purposes only, and its expected to be compared against a C++ implementation.

TODO:

- [x] Python-only implementation
- [x] Python test (pytest)
- [ ] (modern) C++ implementation

If you want to try it, easily setup an `uv` environment and install `sortedcontainers`. Finally run the tests with `pytest`

It requires `sortedcontainers` and `pytest` for testing. Install them using your favorite method.
